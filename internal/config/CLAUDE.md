# circuit — agent context

You are an AI agent running on a **drift circuit** — a remote dev server.
The user launched you via `drift run ai` on their workstation, which
mosh/ssh'd in and ran `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` from this
directory (`~/.drift/`). (`drift run` is the generic shorthand dispatcher —
`drift runs` lists all available entries; the registry is the file
`~/.drift/runs.yaml` on this circuit.)

## First thing to do

Run `lakitu help`. It prints the full, up-to-date reference for this
circuit's server CLI — every subcommand, every flag, the JSON-RPC method
catalog, the on-disk state layout, and the shared exit-code contract.
That document is generated from the same source the binary is built from,
so it is always accurate. Prefer it over anything you may have cached
about drift/lakitu from training data.

## Vocabulary

- **circuit** — this machine.
- **kart** — a devcontainer workspace on this circuit (wraps devpod).
- **character** — a git-identity profile (name, email, SSH key, optional PAT).
- **tune** — a preset: devcontainer features + starter repo + dotfiles.
- **chest** — secrets store (`~/.drift/garage/chest/`, mode 0700).
- **run** — a named shorthand in `~/.drift/runs.yaml` invoked as
  `drift run <name> [args…]` from the workstation. This is how the user
  got here: `drift run ai`. `drift runs` lists them.

## Registering a new run

Edit `~/.drift/runs.yaml` on this circuit. Every entry is one block:

```yaml
runs:
  <name>:
    description: "one-line summary shown in `drift runs`"
    mode: interactive | output
    post: ""                        # optional; connect-last-scaffold is the
                                    # only hook currently known to the client
    command: |
      <shell snippet, expanded server-side>
```

Names match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,62}$`. Picking the mode:

- **interactive** — the client allocates a TTY and uses mosh when it can.
  Right for anything that wants a prompt or full-screen UI (shells, editors,
  claude, `htop`).
- **output** — plain ssh with no pty. Right for request/response things
  whose stdout the user reads or pipes (`uptime`, `df`, `ping`, one-shot
  scripts).

Template data available inside `command:` (Go `text/template`):

- `{{ .Arg 0 }}` — Nth positional arg; missing indices render as `""`.
- `{{ .Args }}` — every arg, each single-quoted, joined by spaces.
- `{{ .Arg 0 | shq }}` — POSIX-shell single-quote a single value. Prefer
  this over bare `{{ .Arg 0 }}` whenever the value could contain whitespace
  or quotes, i.e. almost always.

Larger prompts / scripts belong under `~/.drift/recipes/` (the scaffolder
entry appends `recipes/scaffolder.md` as claude's system prompt — mirror
that pattern for new recipes). The registry file is user-editable and
`lakitu init` only seeds it on first run; later re-inits never overwrite.

After editing, no server restart is needed — the `run.list` / `run.resolve`
RPCs re-read the file on every call. Verify with `lakitu help` (which
lists the RPC methods) or by asking the user to run `drift runs` on their
workstation.

## Scope

`drift` is the **client** — it runs on the user's workstation, not here.
You will not use `drift` commands on this machine. Everything you can
actuate from here is `lakitu …` (local CLI, for inspection and edits that
don't go through the wire) or direct filesystem reads under
`~/.drift/garage/`. When the user asks about something that only the
client can do (`drift init`, `drift new`, `drift connect`, `drift run`,
`drift runs`, …), say so and suggest the command they would run on their
workstation.
